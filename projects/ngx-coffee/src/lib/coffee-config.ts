     * is essential for maintaining a smooth user experience by guiding the user to a specific

     * to the application's home page, a "You have been logged out" page, or the login page for
     * re-authentication.
     *
     * It's important that this URI is pre-registered in the Azure portal as part of your
     * application's configuration settings. The Microsoft Identity Platform validates the 
     * post-logout redirect URI against the registered URIs for security purposes. If the URI
     * used at runtime isn't registered, the redirection will not occur as expected.
     *
     * Configuration in the Azure Portal:
     * 1. Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
     * 2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
     * 3. Select your application.
     * 4. Under "Authentication", add your post-logout redirect URI in the "Logout URL"
     *    section.
     *
     * This URI can be absolute and point to any location that makes sense for your application's
     * user flow. For development purposes, you might use a localhost address, but ensure to
     * update this with the appropriate production URI before deploying your application.
     *
     * Usage Considerations:
     * - Use HTTPS in production: For security reasons, it's recommended to use HTTPS URLs for
     *   post-logout redirects in your production environment.
     * - Keep user experience in mind: Choose a redirect URI that makes sense for your users 
     *   and fits the flow of your application. For example, redirecting to a page that briefly 
     *   informs the user they have been logged out before automatically navigating to the home 
     *   page or login page can enhance clarity.

     * Example:
     * postLogoutRedirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/logout'
